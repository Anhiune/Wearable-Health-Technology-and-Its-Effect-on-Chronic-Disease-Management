# Wearable Health Technology and Its Effect on Chronic Disease Management

### **Project Overview**

This research explores how wearable health technologies—such as glucose monitors, heart rate sensors, and fitness trackers—affect chronic disease outcomes. The study focuses on **patient adherence**, **health improvements**, and **emergency intervention frequency**, comparing patients using wearables to those who do not. Using observational data and a **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** approach, this project aims to provide empirical insights for healthcare stakeholders and policymakers.
### **Research Methodology**

- **Design:** Natural experiment / observational study
- **Econometric Technique:** Difference-in-Differences (DiD) with matched samples
- **Variables:**
    - Health outcomes: e.g., blood sugar, blood pressure
    - Emergency interventions: hospital/emergency visits
    - Adherence: treatment plan compliance metrics
- **Data Sources:** NHIS, Medicare, hospital systems, wearable platforms, survey data
- **Tools Used:** R · Stata · Excel

### **Skill Highlights**

- **Regression Modeling:** Applied DiD and matching techniques to control for confounding variables and estimate causal impacts.
- **Literature Synthesis:** Critically reviewed academic and industry research on wearable health technology and chronic illness outcomes.
- **Scientific Communication:** Wrote a detailed research proposal and literature review; prepared visual slide deck for non-technical stakeholders.

### **Reflection**

> This project strengthened my ability to connect technology trends with health economics, especially in the context of growing chronic disease burdens. I learned to navigate the challenges of observational data, conduct robust empirical analysis, and frame results for both technical and policy audiences. Most importantly, the research deepened my commitment to solving real-world problems at the intersection of technology, healthcare, and public policy.
